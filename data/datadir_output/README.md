# Output data directory

This directory is used to store the output from the EAS pipeline. It contains the following directories:

* `json_out` -- Store a JSON representation of the output from each run of each transit-detection algorithm.

* `mysql` -- Storage for the MySQL databases used by the EAS pipeline. They are stored here and mounted into the Kubernetes cluster, so that database records are persistent when the cluster is restarted.

* `plato_wp36.log` -- Contains all log messages generated by the EAS pipeline.

### Making a fresh start

If you want to start a fresh run of the EAS pipeline, use the script `wipe.sh` to delete all output files and start again from scratch.
