# eas_worker_synthesis_platosim

This Docker container provides a worker node capable of synthesising lightcurves using PLATOsim (work in progress).

See the `README.md` file in the `eas_base` container for a description of how to wrap science codes into custom worker containers in the EAS pipeline.
